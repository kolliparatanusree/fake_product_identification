# Fake product identification system using Blockchain
  Counterfeiting and replication of trademarked products may harm a company's reputation, income, and customer happiness as it expands globally. Counterfeit goods trade and marketing is rapidly increasing. This has a negative impact on a company's sales, reputation, and revenues, as well as posing a risk to potential customers. A fully working blockchain system is suggested to identify and trace fake product across the supply chain, addressing this issue. 
Companies benefit from inexpensive transaction costs and reduced risk of providing counterfeit items to end-users. Fake product builders generate significant challenges for original producers, including brand harm and income losses. Blockchain technology may verify product uniqueness. Blockchain technology prevents tampering with recorded information. When a product is stored on the network, a hash code is generated. This allows for the creation of a chain of transaction records for both the product and its owner. All transaction records will be stored as blocks on the blockchain. The suggested method assigns a QR code or barcode for a product manufactured by the manufacturer, together with its information. By scanning the QR code on the goods, users may determine if it is genuine or counterfeit.
